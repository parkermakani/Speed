Background and Motivation

- Add a minimal cart system to the existing merch shop. On checkout, print a list of items in the cart.

Key Challenges and Analysis

- Integrate cart state across the app without disrupting current UI.
- Keep initial checkout behavior simple: console print (and alert for visibility during manual QA).

High-level Task Breakdown

1. Create Cart context with localStorage persistence. Success: items survive reload; add/remove/quantity work.
2. Wrap app with CartProvider. Success: provider available to app tree.
3. Wire Add to Cart in Merch. Success: clicking adds one item; badge count updates.
4. Add CartPanel UI in drawer with remove/quantity and Checkout prints items. Success: clicking Checkout logs list.
5. Add unit test for add and checkout logging. Success: test passes.

### Background and Motivation

A mobile-first React web app that shows a Mapbox map centered on a live location marker with a pulsing effect and a small quote beneath it. A lightweight FastAPI backend controls the marker location and quote. An admin-only dashboard (protected by a simple password stored in an environment variable) allows updating the location and quote in real time. The system should be skinnable via our own primitives and style tokens, and future-ready for integrations (StreamElements bot, social media scraping near the marker).

### Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Map experience**: Render a pulsing live marker that feels smooth on mobile and desktop; start centered on the marker but allow user panning/zooming after load; ensure good performance on lower-end devices.
- **Marker popups**: Provide responsive popup behaviour—full-screen modal on mobile and anchored Mapbox popup on desktop—for city markers, ensuring smooth performance and accessibility.
- **Marker + quote rendering**: Attach a small quote visually “under” the marker, responsive and readable, without obscuring the map; handle long quotes gracefully (truncate/expand?).
- **Backend simplicity + security**: Provide a simple password-protected admin path using an `.env` password; avoid complex auth at MVP while ensuring non-admin users cannot mutate state.
- **State persistence**: Persist the current location and quote so restarts do not lose data. Keep it minimal (SQLite or JSON file) while enabling future extensions.
- **Design system**: Define our own style tokens (colors, spacing, radii, typography, breakpoints) and a small set of UI primitives to enable fast iteration and consistent mobile-first UI.
- **DX and TDD**: Clear tests for backend endpoints and basic e2e/frontend tests for critical flows. Keep setup light and fast.
- **Future integrations**: Provide boundaries and extensibility for a StreamElements bot to update location/quote and optional social media scraping near the marker (Instagram/Twitter/X).
- **Social media scraping pipeline**: Integrate Apify actors to automatically collect Instagram & TikTok posts mentioning target profiles after a city becomes current; filter by timestamp, location, and keywords; surface results in CityPopup gallery.
- **Quote positioning**: Keep the inspirational quote pinned to a fixed header area of the map rather than rendered near the marker, ensuring readability across breakpoints.
- **City-wide pulsing effect**: Replace the single-point radius with an animated polygon representing the selected city limits; efficiently fetch and render the geometry while maintaining smooth pulse animation.
- **3D marker model**: Investigate embedding a lightweight GLTF model as a marker that reacts to map pitch/bearing for an immersive experience, balancing performance on mobile.
- **UI clean-up**: Remove legacy notices ("last updated", "approximate location") and lat/lon read-outs to streamline the interface.
- **Journey table in Admin**: Maintain the ordered list of cities directly in the backend DB and surface a management table in the admin dashboard. Admin can mark any city as **current** with a toggle. Frontend map consumes DB-driven journey data (no external Google Sheet).

#### New: Contextual Tip System

- **Non-intrusive onboarding**: Surface a help "?" affordance in the top-right that can prompt discovery without blocking primary map interactions.
- **Spotlight dimming**: When a tip references a specific icon/control, the rest of the UI should be dimmed with a "spotlight" left on the referenced control and the tip card itself. Background should be mostly inert while allowing interaction with the highlighted control if required by the tip.
- **Stable targets**: Tips depend on stable selectors/refs for targets (e.g., help button, shop tab, drawer header). Introduce `data-tip-target` attributes as needed.
- **Drawer interplay**: One tip will require opening the Merch drawer. The system must wait for `shopOpen === true` before advancing, and ensure z-index ordering places the tip overlay above the Drawer and its backdrop.
- **Persisted frequency**: Auto-prompt the first tip once after a short delay per session (e.g., 12s), and avoid re-prompting excessively. Use `localStorage` to remember if the prompt was shown/dismissed.
- **Accessibility**: Provide keyboard navigation (Esc to dismiss, Tab cycle within the tip), ARIA roles, and readable contrast over the dim layer.

### High-level System Design

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (Vite), Mapbox GL JS for map. Mobile-first, PWA-ready later if desired. UI primitives built with CSS variables (tokens) + small component library.
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Uvicorn. Simple auth using `.env` admin password. Data persistence via SQLite (SQLModel) or JSON file. CORS allowed for the frontend origin. Endpoints:
  - `GET /status`: returns `{ lat, lng, quote, lastUpdated }`.
  - `POST /status`: updates `{ lat, lng, quote }` (auth required).
  - `POST /auth/login`: returns session token (JWT or signed cookie) on correct password.
  - `POST /auth/logout`: clears session.
- **Auth**: Minimal session cookie (httpOnly) or JWT in Authorization header. MVP can use a short-lived JWT signed with secret from `.env`.
- **Infra**: Dockerfile(s) for frontend and backend. `.env` for secrets and config. Simple deploy to Fly.io/Render/Railway or container hosting.

### Technical Decisions and Conventions

- **Tokens**: Define CSS variables under `:root` for color palette, spacing scale, typography, radii, shadows, and breakpoints. Example: `--color-bg`, `--space-2`, `--font-sans`, `--radius-2`, `--shadow-2`, `--bp-sm`.
- **UI primitives**: `Stack`, `Rows`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `FormField`, `Sheet` (mobile admin), `IconButton`. Keep API small and composable.
- **Map**: Use Mapbox GL JS v3; implement pulsing marker via custom layer or animated canvas per Mapbox example; quote rendered via an HTML `Marker` with a styled container.
- **Data model**: Single `status` record: `{ id: 1, lat: number, lng: number, quote: string, lastUpdated: datetime }`.
- **Validation**: Backend request schema validation for lat/lng ranges and quote length limits.
- **Testing**: Backend with `pytest` + `httpx` async client; minimal frontend tests via Vitest/React Testing Library; optional Playwright e2e later.

### High-level Task Breakdown (with success criteria)

1. Project scaffolding

   - Create `frontend/` and `backend/` folders.
   - Configure Vite (React + TS) and FastAPI projects; add Dockerfiles; set up `README`.
   - Success: Both apps run locally; `GET /status` returns placeholder; frontend loads with placeholder marker/quote.

2. Design tokens and primitives

   - Add `tokens.css` with CSS variables; implement `Stack`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `FormField` primitives with tokens.
   - Success: A demo page shows primitives with responsive behavior; no inline magic values in UI.

3. Map view and pulsing marker

   - Initialize Mapbox with token from `.env`; center on backend-provided marker; implement pulsing effect; attach quote under marker.
   - Respect mobile viewport; add safe-area insets; ensure map starts centered but user can pan/zoom.
   - Success: On load, map is centered on marker with smooth pulsing; quote readable; panning allowed; reload re-centers.

4. Backend endpoints + persistence

   - Implement `GET /status` and `POST /status` with validation; persist to SQLite (SQLModel) or JSON (choose SQLite for durability).
   - Success: Data survives server restarts; invalid inputs rejected with clear errors; timestamps updated.

5. Admin auth (env-based password)

   - `.env` contains `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `JWT_SECRET` (or similar); implement `POST /auth/login` and `POST /auth/logout`.
   - Use httpOnly cookie or JWT bearer; protect `POST /status`.
   - Success: Correct password yields auth; wrong password rejected; protected route inaccessible without auth.

6. Admin dashboard page

   - Add `/admin` route; simple form to update lat/lng and quote; mobile-friendly; uses primitives; shows last updated; shows API errors inline.
   - Success: After login, admin can update data; changes reflected immediately on homepage; form validation prevents bad inputs.

7. TDD and tests

   - Backend unit/integration tests for auth, happy path, validation, unauthorized access, persistence.
   - Frontend unit tests for primitives and map component rendering (mock Mapbox); optional e2e happy path.
   - Success: Tests pass locally and in CI; coverage for critical flows.

8. Production hardening and DX

   - Add CORS config (env-based origins), rate limiting (simple middleware), basic logging/structured errors.
   - Add CI workflow (lint, test) and Docker images; document run/deploy steps.
   - Success: One-command local run; docker-compose works; CI green.

9. Future extensibility hooks (non-functional for now)

   - Reserve `/integrations/streamelements` controller stub and a background worker module.
   - Add internal events/emitters to publish status updates to integrations.
   - Success: Code structure allows plugging in integrations without touching core flows.

10. Quote positioning (frontend)

    - Move quote into a fixed top overlay component that is always visible.
    - Remove quote HTML marker from map.
    - Success: Quote is visible at top of screen on all devices; no quote near pin.

11. City limits pulsing polygon

    - Accept a "city" text input in admin dashboard (reuse Places autocomplete).
    - Resolve city to polygon geometry via Mapbox Geocoding (`types=place` with `polygon_geojson=true`) and store in backend.
    - Render city polygon layer with animated opacity cycle to mimic pulsing; remove old 1-mile radius.
    - Success: Selected city boundary pulses softly, performance ≥30 fps on mobile.

12. 3D marker model

    - Integrate a GLTF/Three.js custom layer anchored at current location.
    - Ensure model scales with zoom and responds to map pitch/bearing.
    - Success: Model replaces icon, shows correct orientation while tilting map.

13. Interface cleanup

    - Remove “Last updated”, “Approximate location within 1 mile” notes from UI.
    - Remove lat/lon footer coordinates.
    - Success: Clean UI with no legacy disclaimers; tests updated.

14. Remove pulsing + city autocomplete (frontend)

    - Deprecate pulsing effect for city polygon; remove animated opacity logic.
    - Simplify city input by removing autocomplete and using admin-provided polygon only.
    - Success: Polygon remains static; admin workflow simplified.

15. Replit deployment & environment configuration

    - 15a. Create `.env` for local development and `.env.example` (checked in) with placeholder values (`MAPBOX_TOKEN`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`, etc.).
    - 15b. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`; commit `.env.example`.
    - 15c. Install `python-dotenv` and update FastAPI `main.py` to load environment variables automatically when present.
    - 15d. Prefix frontend variables with `VITE_` and reference via `import.meta.env` (e.g., `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN`).
    - 15e. Add `.replit` file specifying the run command:
      `   run = "bash replit-run.sh"`
    - 15f. Create `replit-run.sh` script:
      `bash
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      set -e

    # Install backend deps

    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

    # Install frontend deps and build

    cd frontend
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    npm run build
    cd ..

    # Start FastAPI and serve dist/ via StaticFiles

    uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    `

    - 15g. Update `backend/main.py` to serve static files from `frontend/dist` when `os.getenv("ENV") == "production"`.
    - 15h. Document local vs Replit commands in `README.md`.
    - 15i. Add top-level `.gitignore` (see draft below).
    - Success: Clicking **Run** in Replit builds the frontend once and starts the backend, serving the compiled React app on port `8000`; local development workflow (`npm run dev` + `uvicorn --reload`) remains unchanged.

16. Journey table powered by backend DB

    - 16a. **Backend**: Add a `City` SQLModel table with fields: `id`, `city`, `state`, `lat`, `lng`, `order`, `is_current` (bool).
    - 16b. **Backend**: Provide endpoints:
      • `GET /journey` → `{ currentCity, path }` similar to prior spec but sourced from DB.
      • `GET /cities` → list all cities (ordered).
      • `PUT /cities/{id}` → update city fields or toggle `is_current` (admin only).
      • `POST /cities` → add new city (optional future).
    - 16c. **Frontend (Admin)**: Replace location form with a **table** listing all cities in order. Each row shows: index (order), City, State, and a radio button or indicator for **Current**. Changing the indicator triggers mutation to set `is_current=true` for that city and `false` for others; table re-fetches after success.
    - 16d. **Frontend (Public Map)**: Fetch `/journey` to render animated marker at `currentCity`, red dashed polyline via `path`, and pulsing polygon for `currentCity.state` (using existing state-geojson logic).
    - 16e. **Backend logic**: When a new city becomes current, ensure ordering rule: all cities with lower `order` considered past; path constructed accordingly. Provide helper to recompute path list.
    - 16f. **Tests & docs**: Unit tests for City CRUD, current-city toggle, `/journey` response; frontend tests for admin toggle UI and map rendering given mocked data; update README to remove Google Sheet env vars.
    - **Success**: Admin can click to mark a different city as current; site updates within seconds; no external Google Sheet.

17. Sleep Mode toggle

    - 17a. **Backend**: Add `Settings` table (single-row) or extend existing `Status` with `is_sleep` (bool, default false).
    - 17b. **Backend**: Expose `GET /sleep` returning `{ isSleep: boolean }` and `PUT /sleep` to toggle (admin-only).
    - 17c. **Frontend (Admin)**: Add a master "Sleep mode" switch at top of dashboard (e.g., `Toggle` primitive). Updating it calls `PUT /sleep` and shows confirmation.
    - 17d. **Frontend (Public)**: When `isSleep` is true, temporarily replace normal map UI with a **placeholder view** (wired now as: gray background with text "Map is sleeping – come back soon!"; pulse, marker, and paths hidden). Keep page responsive.
    - 17e. **Tests & docs**: Unit tests for sleep endpoints; frontend test that placeholder renders given mocked `isSleep=true`. Update README with explanation.
    - **Success**: Admin can flip Sleep switch; public site swaps to placeholder view within one refresh, switch back resumes full map.

18. Shop drawer overlay

    - 18a. **Frontend**: Create `Drawer` primitive with overlay/backdrop and slide-in/out animation from right; width 100% on mobile (below `--bp-md` breakpoint), 30% on desktop.
    - 18b. **Frontend**: Create `ShopTab` component: small vertical tab anchored to right side with shop icon (`shop.svg`). Clicking toggles Drawer; include hover/focus styles.
    - 18c. **Integration**: Wire `ShopTab` and `Drawer` in `App.tsx`; manage open/close state via React context or local state. Pressing `Esc` or clicking backdrop closes drawer.
    - 18d. **Accessibility**: Trap focus inside drawer, set `aria-modal="true"` and `role="dialog"`; ensure background content is inert (`aria-hidden`).
    - 18e. **Testing**: Unit tests for open/close interactions, keyboard navigation, and responsive width using viewport mocks.
    - **Success**: On mobile (<768px), drawer covers full viewport; on desktop (≥768px), drawer animates to 30% width; background content is scroll-locked; `Esc` and backdrop close it; vertical tab remains visible when drawer is closed.

19. Merch page 3D Model Viewer

    - 19a. **Dependencies**: Add `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` to frontend `package.json` and install via `npm install`.
    - 19b. **3D asset**: Utilize existing `assets/3D/SpeedPin.glb`; create `types/glb.d.ts` to allow TypeScript import of `.glb` files as string URLs.
    - 19c. **Component**: Create `ModelViewer` React component that renders a `<Canvas>` from `@react-three/fiber`, loads the GLB via `useGLTF`, adds ambient + directional lights and `OrbitControls`; accept optional `height?: number` prop (default 260).
    - 19d. **Integration**: Update `components/Merch.tsx` to render `<ModelViewer />` above the products grid, maintaining responsive layout using the `Stack` primitive.
    - 19e. **Styling**: Apply subtle gradient background and rounded corners to the viewer; respect `prefers-reduced-motion` by disabling auto‐rotate.
    - 19f. **Testing**: Add React Testing Library test that mounts `ModelViewer` and expects a `canvas` element to be in the document without runtime errors.
    - **Success**: Opening the shop drawer shows an interactive 3D model viewer above merch items; model loads within 1 s on broadband; grid layout unaffected; all lints and tests pass.

20. Firebase Integration Epic (Auth, Firestore, Storage)

    - 20a. **Project setup**: Create Firebase project, enable Email/Password auth, Firestore, and Cloud Storage. Add service account JSON (backend) and client config (frontend) to `.env.example`.  
      Success: `npm run dev` & `uvicorn` start without errors reading Firebase env vars.

    - 20b. **Frontend Auth**: Install `firebase` SDK; initialize app in `frontend/src/services/firebase.ts`; update `pages/AdminLogin.tsx` to use `signInWithEmailAndPassword` (no registration). Implement `useAuth` hook to provide `user` and `logout`.  
      Success: Admin can log in with existing Firebase account and log out; auth state persists across reload.

    - 20c. **Backend Auth Verification**: Add Firebase Admin SDK (`backend/requirements.txt`); create `backend/firebase.py` to initialize `firebase_admin`; add FastAPI dependency that verifies the Firebase ID token on protected routes. Remove old env-password auth.  
      Success: Valid Firebase ID token allows access; missing/invalid token returns 401.

    - 20d. **Firestore Data Model**: Design `tourData` collection (one doc per city/date) and `merch` collection (one doc per SKU). Write migration script `scripts/migrate_speeddb_to_firestore.py` to read existing `speed.db` and populate Firestore.  
      Success: All rows present in Firestore; script prints summary counts.

    - 20e. **Backend Data Layer**: Replace SQLite queries with Firestore calls in endpoints (`/journey`, `/cities`, `/merch`, etc.). Abstract via repository pattern for testability.  
      Success: API endpoints return same shape as before but backing data now comes from Firestore.

    - 20f. **Cloud Storage for Merch Assets**: Upload merch images to `gs://<bucket>/merch/<filename>`; store `imageUrl` in `merch` documents. Update frontend merch grid to load from `imageUrl`.  
      Success: Images load via public Storage URLs; performance acceptable.

    - 20g. **Security Rules**: Write Firestore and Storage rules allowing reads for everyone and writes only for authenticated admins.  
      Success: Emulator tests pass; unauthorized writes rejected.

    - 20h. **Testing & CI**: Add unit tests mocking Firebase Admin SDK; add Vitest tests for auth flow; update CI to spin up Firebase emulators for backend tests.  
      Success: All tests pass locally and in CI with emulators.

21. City marker popup (frontend)

    - 21a. **Component**: Create `CityPopup` React component that shows city title and gallery grid of `Card` items (placeholder until Firestore images available). Accept `city` prop containing metadata and `onClose`.
    - 21b. **Responsive behavior**: Use `useMediaQuery('--bp-md')` to switch between full-screen `Drawer` on mobile vs anchored Mapbox `Popup` on desktop.
    - 21c. **Map integration**: In Map/FlatMap component, iterate existing city markers; attach `onClick` to set `selectedCity` state and render `CityPopup` accordingly.
    - 21d. **Accessibility & UX**: Provide close button, backdrop (mobile), ESC key close; focus trap.
    - 21e. **Testing**: Unit test that popup opens/closes and renders title based on selected marker; viewport mocked for mobile & desktop.
    - **Success**: Clicking any city marker opens popup with correct city title; on mobile view (<768px) popup covers viewport; closing resumes map interactions; tests pass.

22. Social media integration (Instagram & TikTok via Apify)

- 22a. **Data model**: Add `lastCurrentAt` timestamp column to `City` SQLModel (or Firestore field) to record when `is_current` toggled true.
- 22b. **Backend logic**: Update `/cities/{id}` mutation to set `lastCurrentAt` and ensure only one city is current.
- 22c. **Scraper module**: Install `apify-client` in `backend/requirements.txt`; create `backend/social_scraper.py` that triggers Apify actors for Instagram & TikTok queries like `"@{profile}"` and city keywords since `lastCurrentAt`.
- 22d. **Scheduler**: Add background job scheduler (e.g., `apscheduler` or Celery beat) that runs every `SOCIAL_SCRAPE_INTERVAL_MIN` (env) and populates Firestore `cities/{cityId}/posts`.
- 22e. **Filtering**: Include only posts newer than `lastCurrentAt`, mentioning target profiles/keywords, and (if available) within city geo-bounds (`city_polygon` or ±30 mi bounding box).
- 22f. **Storage**: Persist top 20–100 scored posts per city (fields: `platform`, `postId`, `username`, `caption`, `mediaUrl`, `likes`, `timestamp`, `lat`, `lng`, `score`).
- 22g. **API endpoint**: Expose `GET /cities/{id}/posts` returning list of post DTOs sorted by score desc (anonymous).
- 22h. **Frontend**: Update `CityPopup` to fetch posts and render as `Card` gallery; gracefully handle loading/empty/error states.
- 22i. **Testing & docs**: Unit tests mocking Apify responses, integration tests for endpoint, Vitest tests for gallery rendering; update README/env docs (`APIFY_TOKEN`, `SOCIAL_SCRAPE_INTERVAL_MIN`, `SOCIAL_PROFILES`).
- **Success**: After toggling a city to current, within the configured interval its popup shows a gallery of relevant IG/TikTok posts; tests pass and manual spot-check shows accuracy.

24. Contextual Tip System (frontend)

- 24a. Inject Help affordance: Add a small circular "?" help button to the top-right overlay stack (inside `App.tsx` overlay near `Header`). Temporary implementation can be a styled button; later we can swap to an SVG icon.

  - Success: Button renders at top-right on all breakpoints with z-index above header; click opens tip sequence.

- 24b. Tip data model: Define a typed `TipStep` array with fields `{ id, imageUrl, target: SelectorOrRef, placement, continueMode }` where `continueMode` ∈ `"nextButton" | "clickTarget" | "waitCondition"`.

  - Success: Strongly typed steps; compile-time safety; initial steps include:
    1.  Prompt: points at the help button, continueMode = `nextButton`.
    2.  Discover Merch: points at ShopTab, continueMode = `clickTarget` (user must open).
    3.  Inside Merch: anchors to Drawer header or first card area, continueMode = `nextButton`.

- 24c. Spotlight overlay: Implement `SpotlightOverlay` that dims the page with 4 absolute-positioned rectangles around a computed bounding rect of the target to leave a “hole” over the target. Allow pointer-events only through the hole and tip card; block elsewhere.

  - Success: Background is visually dim; only target area remains fully visible and clickable; smooth on resize/scroll; no layout shift.

- 24d. TipSystem component + context: Manage current step index, expose `start()`, `next()`, `close()`, and auto-prompt logic (e.g., show first tip once after 12s if never seen this session). Persist `tipPromptShown` and `tipCompletedIds` in `localStorage`.

  - Success: Auto-prompt happens once per session; manual trigger via help button works; state survives quick navigations.

  - 24d.1. Auto-prompt settings (CONFIRMED): Delay 12 seconds, frequency once per session.
    - Success: After 12s idle on first visit of session, show tip-1; do not re-show after dismissal until a new session.

- 24e. Merch drawer integration: Wire a step whose `continueMode = "clickTarget"` to require opening the drawer. Observe `shopOpen` state from `App.tsx` via context/props to detect when to advance to the next step. Ensure tip overlay stacks above Drawer/backdrop.

  - Success: When user taps ShopTab, drawer opens and tips continue; overlay doesn’t obstruct the ShopTab’s clickable area.

  - 24e.1. Required action (CONFIRMED): Opening the Merch drawer is required to proceed (no skip on that step).

- 24f. Accessibility and controls: Esc closes tips; arrow/Tab navigation constrained within tip card; tip card has `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`.

  - Success: Keyboard-only user can operate; screen reader announces tip content.

  - 24f.1. "Don’t show again" (CONFIRMED): Provide a control to suppress future auto-prompts and sequences; persist in `localStorage` (e.g., `tips_suppressed = true`).

- 24g. Tests: Add Vitest/RTL tests to verify auto-prompt gating, step advancement, spotlight hole math around a mocked target, and the drawer-advance condition.

  - Success: Tests pass locally and in CI; no lints introduced.

- 24h. Assets: Use existing `frontend/src/assets/Tips/tip-1.png` (and siblings) for the image content in the tip card. Lazy-load subsequent images just-in-time.

  - Success: Images render crisp on mobile & desktop; no layout jank.

  - 24i. Customizable order (CONFIRMED): `tip-1.png` is always the initial prompt; subsequent steps order is configurable.

    - Implement `frontend/src/tips/tipsConfig.ts` exporting a `TipStep[]` constructed from reusable step templates. User can reorder steps without code changes elsewhere.
    - Success: Reordering `tipsConfig` changes runtime sequence immediately.

  - 24j. Targets & anchors (CONFIRMED): Spotlight targets include Help, ShopTab, Quote, Current City marker, Merch first card, Animation star icons, and a future Time Limit badge.
    - Introduce stable anchors via `data-tip-target` attributes:
      - Help: `data-tip-target="help"` (Help button in overlay)
      - ShopTab: `data-tip-target="shoptab"` (root of `ShopTab`)
      - Quote: `data-tip-target="quote"` (wrapper in `Quote.tsx`)
      - Current city: `data-tip-target="current-city"` (Mapbox marker container in `FlatMap.tsx`)
      - Merch card: `data-tip-target="merch-card"` (first product `Card` in `Merch.tsx`)
      - Animation icons: `data-tip-target="anim-icons"` (container around the shape buttons)
      - Time limit: `data-tip-target="time-limit"` (placeholder element adjacent to price; becomes active when feature lands)
    - Success: Spotlight positions correctly over each target; when a target does not exist yet (e.g., time limit), that step is deferred or skipped gracefully with clear messaging.

23. Lightweight 3D Model Viewer (SpeedLowPoly + animation selector)

    - 23a. **Asset Preparation**: Use the new `assets/3D/SpeedLowPoly.glb` (already low-poly with baked animation). Verify file ≤5 MB; if larger, consider Draco compression via `gltf-pipeline`.
    - 23b. **Viewer Refactor**: Update `ModelViewer.tsx` to default to this GLB and expose available animations via `useAnimations`. Accept props:
      • `initialAnimation?: string` (default first)
      • `onAnimationChange?(name: string)`
    - 23c. **Animation Switching UI**: Add a small segmented control/drop-down inside `Merch.tsx` (desktop) or below canvas (mobile) listing animation clips (e.g., "Idle", "Wave", "Ride"). Switching updates `actions[current].play()` and fades out previous.
    - 23d. **Progressive Loading**: Show static PNG placeholder (existing `SpeedMotorcycle_00000.png`) wrapped in `Suspense` fallback; display load % via `useProgress` in dev mode.
    - 23e. **Performance Budget**: TTI impact ≤100 ms, memory ≤20 MB on simulated mid-range mobile. Document Lighthouse numbers in PR description.
    - 23f. **Testing**: Vitest test mounts viewer, waits for GLTF loader promise resolve, and asserts that animation mixer exists. Test animation switch triggers `play` on new action without console errors.
    - 23g. **Clothing Variants Pipeline**:
      • Export **shirtless base model** (`SpeedLowPoly_Base.glb`) but KEEP a distinct skinned **shirt mesh** whose material is named `ShirtMaterial`. Leave its texture slot empty or a neutral placeholder.
      • For each merch design, export a **texture PNG (or jpg, KTX2)** named `<sku>_Shirt_Diffuse.png` sized ≤1 k px, targeting the UVs of `ShirtMaterial`.
      • Optimise textures via `squoosh-cli --mozjpeg` or Basis/KTX2 if GPU compression desired; place outputs in `assets/3D/shirts/`.
    - 23h. **Viewer Clothing API**:
      • Extend `ModelViewer.tsx` with `shirtTexture?: string` prop.
      • On change, find the mesh whose material.name === `ShirtMaterial`.
      • Determine shirtless state by checking if `material.map?.name === "ShitBaseTexture"` (placeholder base texture). If yes, hide: `material.transparent=true; material.opacity=0` (or `mesh.visible=false`).
      • When a merch texture is provided, load with `TextureLoader` (or `useTexture`), assign to `material.map`, restore opacity/visibility, and set `material.needsUpdate = true`. Optionally fade between textures.
    - 23i. **Animation System**:
      • Use `useAnimations` from `@react-three/drei` to bind clips returned by `useGLTF`.
      • Build an `animationNames` array from `clips.map(c => c.name)`; default play first clip.
      • Expose `currentAnimation` and `setAnimation` via component props OR internal state + UI (segmented control/drop-down).
      • When animation changes: `actions[prev].fadeOut(0.2); actions[next].reset().fadeIn(0.2).play();`.
    - 23j. **Merch Drawer Integration**:
      • Ensure each merch document in Firestore includes `shirtTexture` (relative URL like `shirts/<sku>_Shirt_Diffuse.png`) and optional `defaultAnimation`.
      • Update `services/api.ts` merch fetch to include this field; extend `MerchItem` TypeScript type accordingly.
      • `Merch.tsx`: on merch card click, pass `item.shirtTexture` to `<ModelViewer shirtTexture={...} />`; also switch animation if `defaultAnimation` present.
    - 23k. **Testing**: Unit test texture swap updates `material.map.uuid` and animation switch triggers new clip without console errors.
    - **Success**: Viewer loads base model; texture swap on shirt mesh works instantly when merch clicked; user can switch among available animation clips; performance budgets intact; tests & lints pass.

#### 24.x Implementation Details & Remaining Plan

- **Targets implemented**:

  - `data-tip-target="help"` → Help button (top-right)
  - `data-tip-target="shoptab"` → `ShopTab` root (right side)
  - `data-tip-target="quote"` → `Quote` wrapper
  - `data-tip-target="current-city"` → animated marker container in `FlatMap`
  - `data-tip-target="merch-card"` → first merch `Card` in `Merch`
  - `data-tip-target="anim-icons"` → container around animation icon buttons in `Merch`

- **Config & step sequence** (`frontend/src/tips/tipsConfig.ts`):

  - Steps added for Help prompt, Quote, Current City, ShopTab (click required), Merch first card, Animation icons.
  - Order is fully customizable; set `continueMode` per step: `tapAnywhere`, `clickTarget`, or `waitCondition`.
  - Desktop/mobile placements editable via `placementDesktop` / `placementMobile` with `{ anchor, offsetX, offsetY, rotationDeg }`.

- **Debug & authoring**:

  - URL flags: `tipsForce=1` to start immediately; `tipsDebug=1` to enable drag; `tipsStep=<id>` or `tipsIndex=<n>` to jump to a specific step.
  - In debug, drag the tip image to refine offsets; press “Copy placement” to paste into the config for permanence.

- **Spotlight readiness**:

  - Overlay renders only after the target element exists; system checks every 200 ms and renders once found.
  - For elements rendered later (e.g., map marker), scroll/pan if needed; overlay will attach once target appears.

- **Persistence**:

  - Auto-prompt shown once per session (12 s after load). `Don’t show again` persists suppression in `localStorage`.
  - Drag-adjusted positions persist in-memory for the session; copy/paste into config to make them permanent.

- **Accessibility**:

  - Dimming uses high-contrast overlay; tip is keyboard-focusable; Esc closes; background inertness via overlay.

- **Next steps**:
  - Add optional `waitCondition` for “time limit” badge (`data-tip-target="time-limit"`) once implemented.
  - Write unit tests for: auto-prompt gating, step advancement (tapAnywhere/clickTarget), target readiness polling, and spotlight geometry.
  - Consider persisting per-device placement overrides in `localStorage` keyed by step id and breakpoint.

### Current Status / Progress Tracking

|- 🚀 Firebase integration epic complete: Frontend auth, backend token verification, Firestore data layer, Cloud Storage images (pending merch images upload manually).
|- 🛠️ Task 20e: Added `backend/firestore_repo.py`; refactored `/api/status` GET & POST to use Firestore. Next: refactor `/cities`, `/journey`, `/sleep` endpoints.
|- ✅ Task 20b complete: Front-end AuthProvider & AdminLogin now use Firebase. Manual test pending but code compiles.
|- 🛠️ Started task 20c: Updated `backend/auth.py` to verify ID tokens via Firebase Admin and changed protected route dependency. Deprecated old /api/auth/login/logout endpoints in `backend/main.py`.
|- 🐞 Task 22 progress: Debug run produced IG:1, TW:10 raw posts but 0 after filtering; needs filter & search refinement (see Task 22e–22f).

|- 📝 Planned: Tip System
| - Help button location: top-right of overlay stack (above `Header`)
| - Auto-prompt: show tip-1 once after ~12s per session
| - Spotlight: 4-rect approach to leave interactive hole over target
| - First target: help button; second target: `ShopTab`; third: Drawer header
| - Z-index plan: Tip overlay 3000+, above Drawer (1500) and ShopTab (1400)

### Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Please create a Firebase project (if not already) and download a service account JSON key.
- Place the JSON somewhere outside the repo and set `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` in your `.env` to its absolute path.
- Fill in the VITE*FIREBASE*\* variables in `.env` with values from **Project Settings → General → Your apps**.
- Let me know when credentials are in place so I can run the project locally and confirm successful initialisation before proceeding to frontend auth (task 20b).
- Please verify that the _current city_ document has an accurate `lastCurrentAt` ISO timestamp (e.g., within the last 48 h) so filters do not exclude valid posts. If stale, toggle city to current again to refresh the timestamp for testing.

- Tip System confirmations requested:
  - Confirm the auto-prompt delay (proposed 12 seconds) and frequency (per session).
  - Provide the desired order and copy for tips (we will use `Tips/tip-1.png`, `tip-2.png`, etc.).
  - Confirm which controls we should spotlight beyond Help and ShopTab (add any other icon targets).
  - Is the “open Merch drawer” step required to proceed, or should we allow a skip? Proposed: required to proceed for onboarding.
  - Do we need a “Don’t show again” control in the tip card?

### Recent Enhancements (Latest Session)

#### ✅ **Design System Updates**

- **American Theme Implementation**: Added patriotic color palette with Liberty Blue (#0A3161), Freedom Red (#B31942), Star White (#FFFFFF), Steel Gray (#4B4B4B), Sky Stripe (#3C8DFF), and Vintage Gold (#FFD700)
- **Site Branding**: Replaced chromatic text header with "Speed Does America" graphic logo from assets
- **Typography**: Integrated HWT American Adobe Font for authentic American aesthetic

#### ✅ **Privacy-Focused Location System**

- **1-Mile Privacy Zone**: Replaced expanding pulse ring with fixed 1-mile radius circle
- **Random Location Offset**: Generates random point within 1-mile radius to protect exact location privacy
- **Privacy Indicator**: Added "Approximate location within 1 mile" notice in map popup
- **Random Location Icons**: 11 different location markers that randomly select on each page load
- **Gentle Animation**: Subtle transparency pulse on the area circle instead of aggressive expanding rings

#### ✅ **Google Places API Integration**

- **Backend Proxy**: Created `/places/search` endpoint to avoid CORS issues with direct Google API calls
- **Real-time Autocomplete**: Address search with debounced queries (300ms) and up to 5 suggestions
- **Smart Coordinate Population**: Auto-fills lat/lng fields when user selects from address suggestions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys, Enter, and Escape support for accessibility
- **Enhanced UX**: Loading states, error handling, and focus management

#### ✅ **Map System Improvements**

- **Coordinate Validation**: Added safeguards against invalid lat/lng values causing Mapbox errors
- **Simplified Offset Algorithm**: Replaced complex trigonometric calculations with simpler degree-based offsets
- **Fixed Lat/Lng Order Bug**: getRandomOffsetLocation now returns coordinates in [lng, lat] order, resolving Mapbox "Invalid LngLat latitude" error
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of edge cases and invalid coordinate scenarios
- **Performance**: Optimized random calculations and reduced complexity

#### ⚠️ **Known Issues**

- **React Boolean Warning**: Still receiving "Received `false` for a non-boolean attribute `error`" in console
- **Input Component**: Need to verify onKeyDown prop is properly handled in primitives
- \*\*Mapbox "Invalid LngLat latitude value" error due to swapped lat/lng order (fixed by returning [lng, lat] in helper).~~

#### 🚧 **Technical Debt**

- Need comprehensive testing for new Google Places integration
- Should add environment variable validation for Google API key
- Consider adding rate limiting for Places API proxy endpoint

- 🚧 **Next**: Task 7 (Tests for backend + minimal frontend coverage)
- 🔨 **Executor**: Backend city data layer operational; proceeding to frontend admin UI next session.

#### ✅ **Shop Drawer Fixes**

- Fixed back/close button inside Tour Merch drawer not closing the drawer (ensured `onClose` wiring and verified state update)
- Switched chevron icon direction from `right-chevron` to `left-chevron` for better UX consistency (in both `Drawer` close button and `ShopTab` toggle)
- No linter issues introduced; manual functional test pending

- Fixed dev JSON parse error by reading `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `frontend/src/services/api.ts`; falls back to `window.location.origin` for production.
