Background and Motivation

- Add a minimal cart system to the existing merch shop. On checkout, print a list of items in the cart.

Key Challenges and Analysis

- Integrate cart state across the app without disrupting current UI.
- Keep initial checkout behavior simple: console print (and alert for visibility during manual QA).

High-level Task Breakdown

1. Create Cart context with localStorage persistence. Success: items survive reload; add/remove/quantity work.
2. Wrap app with CartProvider. Success: provider available to app tree.
3. Wire Add to Cart in Merch. Success: clicking adds one item; badge count updates.
4. Add CartPanel UI in drawer with remove/quantity and Checkout prints items. Success: clicking Checkout logs list.
5. Add unit test for add and checkout logging. Success: test passes.

### Feature Flag: Disable Merch

Background and Motivation

- Allow admins to disable all merch capabilities site-wide via a single setting, hiding the shop tab, drawer/cart UI, and merch grid without breaking layout.

Key Challenges and Analysis

- Provide a durable flag stored in Firestore-backed settings and surfaced via `/api/settings`.
- Ensure frontend gates all merch entry points (ShopTab, Drawer, Cart) while avoiding runtime errors in components that assume cart context.
- Keep backward compatibility: default to enabled (false) and avoid undefined states.

High-level Task Breakdown

1. Backend: Add `disableMerch` (boolean, default false) to settings defaults and accept updates via `PUT /api/settings`. Success: `GET /api/settings` returns `disableMerch` key.
2. Frontend types/API: Extend `Settings` and ensure fetch ensures boolean default. Success: Type compiles; `fetchSettings()` returns object with `disableMerch`.
3. Admin UI: Add checkbox to toggle `disableMerch` in Settings card and persist with Save. Success: Toggling reflects in subsequent `GET /api/settings`.
4. App gating: Hide `ShopTab` and `Drawer` when `disableMerch` is true. Success: No merch/cart UI is visible; app functions normally otherwise.

Project Status Board (Disable Merch)

- [x] 1. Backend flag in defaults and update schema
- [x] 2. Frontend types and API integration
- [x] 3. Admin checkbox UI
- [x] 4. App gating in `App.tsx`

Current Status / Progress Tracking

- Implemented end-to-end disableMerch feature flag. No linter errors. Ready for manual verification in Admin Dashboard.

Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Please test toggling the "Disable Merch" checkbox in the Admin Dashboard, click Save, refresh the public site, and confirm the shop tab/cart are hidden when enabled and restored when disabled.

Lessons

- Favor server-provided feature flags (via `/api/settings`) over build-time env for runtime control without deployments.

#### Social Posts Deduplication (Firestore write-layer)

Background and Motivation

- We observed duplicate social posts appearing in `cities/{cityId}/posts`. While upstream scrapers (including Curator) attempt to dedupe, enforcing uniqueness at the write layer ensures consistency regardless of source quirks or scheduler races.

Key Challenges and Analysis

- Posts may arrive with different shapes: `id`, `postId`, or only canonical `url`. Some items can lack both and only have text+timestamp. We need a stable dedupe key hierarchy.

High-level Task Breakdown

1. Add dedupe in `backend/firestore_repo.py::save_city_posts` prior to sorting and writes. Success: For any input list with duplicates by platform+postId or canonical URL, only one is written.
2. Keep a safe fallback key when both id and url are missing to reduce accidental dupes while avoiding data loss. Success: No crash; ambiguous items are still saved once per unique (platform, timestamp, caption-prefix).

Project Status Board

- [x] Add dedupe in Firestore save_city_posts (platform+postId or canonical URL)

Current Status / Progress Tracking

- Implemented dedupe in `save_city_posts`: builds a key as `pid:{platform}:{postId}` when available, else `url:{canonicalUrl}`, else `tscap:{platform}:{timestamp}:{captionPrefix}`. Then sorts newest→oldest and writes with existing batching. No lints.

Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Please run a manual scrape and verify that subsequent runs do not increase subcollection size due to duplicate items. If you notice a missed duplicate pattern, share example fields so we can extend the key builder.

Lessons

- Enforce invariants at the write boundary even if upstream sources attempt dedupe; this provides defense-in-depth against race conditions and heterogeneous payload shapes.

### Shopify Integration (Optional)

Background and Motivation

- Replicate Shopify Buy Button functionality (collection listing and checkout) while keeping our styling and without relying on embedded UI. Must not break when example products or missing config are present.

Key Challenges and Analysis

- Use Storefront API with env-driven config; fall back to existing `/api/merch` when not configured.
- Preserve our `Card`, `Button`, and layout. Only data layer changes.
- Checkout: create Shopify Checkout when possible; otherwise keep current summary alert.

High-level Task Breakdown

1. Add Shopify client util using Storefront API (env-driven). Success: `isShopifyConfigured()` toggles behavior; GraphQL queries work.
2. Map Shopify collection products to our `MerchItem` shape (id, name, price, imageUrl, url, active).
3. Update `Merch.tsx` hook to fetch from Shopify when configured, else from backend API.
4. Enhance `CartPanel` checkout: if Shopify configured and items have variant IDs, create checkout and open `webUrl`; else show summary.
5. Update `env.example` with Shopify vars; do not commit secrets.

Project Status Board (Shopify)

- [x] 1. Shopify client util (env-driven)
- [x] 2. Product mapping to our type
- [x] 3. Merch uses Shopify when configured
- [x] 4. Checkout opens Shopify webUrl when possible
- [x] 5. Env docs added

Current Status / Progress Tracking

- Implemented `frontend/src/services/shopify.ts`; integrated into `Merch.tsx` and `CartPanel.tsx`. No linter issues. Safe fallback maintained.

Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Provide `VITE_SHOPIFY_DOMAIN`, `VITE_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN`, and either `VITE_SHOPIFY_COLLECTION_HANDLE` or `VITE_SHOPIFY_COLLECTION_ID` in `.env` to enable Shopify sourcing. Without these, app continues using backend merch API.

Lessons

- Prefer Storefront API over Buy Button SDK to preserve design system and avoid iframe/UI injection; gate by env to avoid breaking when configs are absent.

Current Status / Progress Tracking

- Implemented context, provider, UI, and header cart toggle with badge. Added `CartPanel`. Wrote unit test; running tests next.

Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- None currently. If we later want real checkout, we can integrate a payment provider.

Lessons

- Include visible confirmation (alert) in addition to console logging to aid manual testing.

### Background and Motivation

A mobile-first React web app that shows a Mapbox map centered on a live location marker with a pulsing effect and a small quote beneath it. A lightweight FastAPI backend controls the marker location and quote. An admin-only dashboard (protected by a simple password stored in an environment variable) allows updating the location and quote in real time. The system should be skinnable via our own primitives and style tokens, and future-ready for integrations (StreamElements bot, social media scraping near the marker).

### Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Map experience**: Render a pulsing live marker that feels smooth on mobile and desktop; start centered on the marker but allow user panning/zooming after load; ensure good performance on lower-end devices.
- **Marker popups**: Provide responsive popup behaviour—full-screen modal on mobile and anchored Mapbox popup on desktop—for city markers, ensuring smooth performance and accessibility.
- **Marker + quote rendering**: Attach a small quote visually “under” the marker, responsive and readable, without obscuring the map; handle long quotes gracefully (truncate/expand?).
- **Backend simplicity + security**: Provide a simple password-protected admin path using an `.env` password; avoid complex auth at MVP while ensuring non-admin users cannot mutate state.
- **State persistence**: Persist the current location and quote so restarts do not lose data. Keep it minimal (SQLite or JSON file) while enabling future extensions.
- **Design system**: Define our own style tokens (colors, spacing, radii, typography, breakpoints) and a small set of UI primitives to enable fast iteration and consistent mobile-first UI.
- **DX and TDD**: Clear tests for backend endpoints and basic e2e/frontend tests for critical flows. Keep setup light and fast.
- **Future integrations**: Provide boundaries and extensibility for a StreamElements bot to update location/quote and optional social media scraping near the marker (Instagram/Twitter/X).
- **Social media scraping pipeline**: Integrate Apify actors to automatically collect Instagram & TikTok posts mentioning target profiles after a city becomes current; filter by timestamp, location, and keywords; surface results in CityPopup gallery.
- **Quote positioning**: Keep the inspirational quote pinned to a fixed header area of the map rather than rendered near the marker, ensuring readability across breakpoints.
- **City-wide pulsing effect**: Replace the single-point radius with an animated polygon representing the selected city limits; efficiently fetch and render the geometry while maintaining smooth pulse animation.
- **3D marker model**: Investigate embedding a lightweight GLTF model as a marker that reacts to map pitch/bearing for an immersive experience, balancing performance on mobile.
- **UI clean-up**: Remove legacy notices ("last updated", "approximate location") and lat/lon read-outs to streamline the interface.
- **Journey table in Admin**: Maintain the ordered list of cities directly in the backend DB and surface a management table in the admin dashboard. Admin can mark any city as **current** with a toggle. Frontend map consumes DB-driven journey data (no external Google Sheet).

#### New: Contextual Tip System

- **Non-intrusive onboarding**: Surface a help "?" affordance in the top-right that can prompt discovery without blocking primary map interactions.
- **Spotlight dimming**: When a tip references a specific icon/control, the rest of the UI should be dimmed with a "spotlight" left on the referenced control and the tip card itself. Background should be mostly inert while allowing interaction with the highlighted control if required by the tip.
- **Stable targets**: Tips depend on stable selectors/refs for targets (e.g., help button, shop tab, drawer header). Introduce `data-tip-target` attributes as needed.
- **Drawer interplay**: One tip will require opening the Merch drawer. The system must wait for `shopOpen === true` before advancing, and ensure z-index ordering places the tip overlay above the Drawer and its backdrop.
- **Persisted frequency**: Auto-prompt the first tip once after a short delay per session (e.g., 12s), and avoid re-prompting excessively. Use `localStorage` to remember if the prompt was shown/dismissed.
- **Accessibility**: Provide keyboard navigation (Esc to dismiss, Tab cycle within the tip), ARIA roles, and readable contrast over the dim layer.

### High-level System Design

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (Vite), Mapbox GL JS for map. Mobile-first, PWA-ready later if desired. UI primitives built with CSS variables (tokens) + small component library.
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Uvicorn. Simple auth using `.env` admin password. Data persistence via SQLite (SQLModel) or JSON file. CORS allowed for the frontend origin. Endpoints:
  - `GET /status`: returns `{ lat, lng, quote, lastUpdated }`.
  - `POST /status`: updates `{ lat, lng, quote }` (auth required).
  - `POST /auth/login`: returns session token (JWT or signed cookie) on correct password.
  - `POST /auth/logout`: clears session.
- **Auth**: Minimal session cookie (httpOnly) or JWT in Authorization header. MVP can use a short-lived JWT signed with secret from `.env`.
- **Infra**: Dockerfile(s) for frontend and backend. `.env` for secrets and config. Simple deploy to Fly.io/Render/Railway or container hosting.

### Technical Decisions and Conventions

- **Tokens**: Define CSS variables under `:root` for color palette, spacing scale, typography, radii, shadows, and breakpoints. Example: `--color-bg`, `--space-2`, `--font-sans`, `--radius-2`, `--shadow-2`, `--bp-sm`.
- **UI primitives**: `Stack`, `Rows`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `FormField`, `Sheet` (mobile admin), `IconButton`. Keep API small and composable.
- **Map**: Use Mapbox GL JS v3; implement pulsing marker via custom layer or animated canvas per Mapbox example; quote rendered via an HTML `Marker` with a styled container.
- **Data model**: Single `status` record: `{ id: 1, lat: number, lng: number, quote: string, lastUpdated: datetime }`.
- **Validation**: Backend request schema validation for lat/lng ranges and quote length limits.
- **Testing**: Backend with `pytest` + `httpx` async client; minimal frontend tests via Vitest/React Testing Library; optional Playwright e2e later.

### High-level Task Breakdown (with success criteria)

1. Project scaffolding

   - Create `frontend/` and `backend/` folders.
   - Configure Vite (React + TS) and FastAPI projects; add Dockerfiles; set up `README`.
   - Success: Both apps run locally; `GET /status` returns placeholder; frontend loads with placeholder marker/quote.

2. Design tokens and primitives

   - Add `tokens.css` with CSS variables; implement `Stack`, `Text`, `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `FormField` primitives with tokens.
   - Success: A demo page shows primitives with responsive behavior; no inline magic values in UI.

3. Map view and pulsing marker

   - Initialize Mapbox with token from `.env`; center on backend-provided marker; implement pulsing effect; attach quote under marker.
   - Respect mobile viewport; add safe-area insets; ensure map starts centered but user can pan/zoom.
   - Success: On load, map is centered on marker with smooth pulsing; quote readable; panning allowed; reload re-centers.

4. Backend endpoints + persistence

   - Implement `GET /status` and `POST /status` with validation; persist to SQLite (SQLModel) or JSON (choose SQLite for durability).
   - Success: Data survives server restarts; invalid inputs rejected with clear errors; timestamps updated.

5. Admin auth (env-based password)

   - `.env` contains `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `JWT_SECRET` (or similar); implement `POST /auth/login` and `POST /auth/logout`.
   - Use httpOnly cookie or JWT bearer; protect `POST /status`.
   - Success: Correct password yields auth; wrong password rejected; protected route inaccessible without auth.

6. Admin dashboard page

   - Add `/admin` route; simple form to update lat/lng and quote; mobile-friendly; uses primitives; shows last updated; shows API errors inline.
   - Success: After login, admin can update data; changes reflected immediately on homepage; form validation prevents bad inputs.

7. TDD and tests

   - Backend unit/integration tests for auth, happy path, validation, unauthorized access, persistence.
   - Frontend unit tests for primitives and map component rendering (mock Mapbox); optional e2e happy path.
   - Success: Tests pass locally and in CI; coverage for critical flows.

8. Production hardening and DX

   - Add CORS config (env-based origins), rate limiting (simple middleware), basic logging/structured errors.
   - Add CI workflow (lint, test) and Docker images; document run/deploy steps.
   - Success: One-command local run; docker-compose works; CI green.

9. Future extensibility hooks (non-functional for now)

   - Reserve `/integrations/streamelements` controller stub and a background worker module.
   - Add internal events/emitters to publish status updates to integrations.
   - Success: Code structure allows plugging in integrations without touching core flows.

10. Quote positioning (frontend)

    - Move quote into a fixed top overlay component that is always visible.
    - Remove quote HTML marker from map.
    - Success: Quote is visible at top of screen on all devices; no quote near pin.

11. City limits pulsing polygon

    - Accept a "city" text input in admin dashboard (reuse Places autocomplete).
    - Resolve city to polygon geometry via Mapbox Geocoding (`types=place` with `polygon_geojson=true`) and store in backend.
    - Render city polygon layer with animated opacity cycle to mimic pulsing; remove old 1-mile radius.
    - Success: Selected city boundary pulses softly, performance ≥30 fps on mobile.

12. 3D marker model

    - Integrate a GLTF/Three.js custom layer anchored at current location.
    - Ensure model scales with zoom and responds to map pitch/bearing.
    - Success: Model replaces icon, shows correct orientation while tilting map.

13. Interface cleanup

    - Remove “Last updated”, “Approximate location within 1 mile” notes from UI.
    - Remove lat/lon footer coordinates.
    - Success: Clean UI with no legacy disclaimers; tests updated.

14. Remove pulsing + city autocomplete (frontend)

    - Deprecate pulsing effect for city polygon; remove animated opacity logic.
    - Simplify city input by removing autocomplete and using admin-provided polygon only.
    - Success: Polygon remains static; admin workflow simplified.

15. Replit deployment & environment configuration

    - 15a. Create `.env` for local development and `.env.example` (checked in) with placeholder values (`MAPBOX_TOKEN`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`, etc.).
    - 15b. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`; commit `.env.example`.
    - 15c. Install `python-dotenv` and update FastAPI `main.py` to load environment variables automatically when present.
    - 15d. Prefix frontend variables with `VITE_` and reference via `import.meta.env` (e.g., `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN`).
    - 15e. Add `.replit` file specifying the run command:
      `   run = "bash replit-run.sh"`
    - 15f. Create `replit-run.sh` script:
      `bash
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      set -e

    # Install backend deps

    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

    # Install frontend deps and build

    cd frontend
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    npm run build
    cd ..

    # Start FastAPI and serve dist/ via StaticFiles

    uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    `

    - 15g. Update `backend/main.py` to serve static files from `frontend/dist` when `os.getenv("ENV") == "production"`.
    - 15h. Document local vs Replit commands in `README.md`.
    - 15i. Add top-level `.gitignore` (see draft below).
    - Success: Clicking **Run** in Replit builds the frontend once and starts the backend, serving the compiled React app on port `8000`; local development workflow (`npm run dev` + `uvicorn --reload`) remains unchanged.

16. Journey table powered by backend DB

    - 16a. **Backend**: Add a `City` SQLModel table with fields: `id`, `city`, `state`, `lat`, `lng`, `order`, `is_current` (bool).
    - 16b. **Backend**: Provide endpoints:
      • `GET /journey` → `{ currentCity, path }` similar to prior spec but sourced from DB.
      • `GET /cities` → list all cities (ordered).
      • `PUT /cities/{id}` → update city fields or toggle `is_current` (admin only).
      • `POST /cities` → add new city (optional future).
    - 16c. **Frontend (Admin)**: Replace location form with a **table** listing all cities in order. Each row shows: index (order), City, State, and a radio button or indicator for **Current**. Changing the indicator triggers mutation to set `is_current=true` for that city and `false` for others; table re-fetches after success.
    - 16d. **Frontend (Public Map)**: Fetch `/journey` to render animated marker at `currentCity`, red dashed polyline via `path`, and pulsing polygon for `currentCity.state` (using existing state-geojson logic).
    - 16e. **Backend logic**: When a new city becomes current, ensure ordering rule: all cities with lower `order` considered past; path constructed accordingly. Provide helper to recompute path list.
    - 16f. **Tests & docs**: Unit tests for City CRUD, current-city toggle, `/journey` response; frontend tests for admin toggle UI and map rendering given mocked data; update README to remove Google Sheet env vars.
    - **Success**: Admin can click to mark a different city as current; site updates within seconds; no external Google Sheet.

17. Sleep Mode toggle

    - 17a. **Backend**: Add `Settings` table (single-row) or extend existing `Status` with `is_sleep` (bool, default false).
    - 17b. **Backend**: Expose `GET /sleep` returning `{ isSleep: boolean }` and `PUT /sleep` to toggle (admin-only).
    - 17c. **Frontend (Admin)**: Add a master "Sleep mode" switch at top of dashboard (e.g., `Toggle` primitive). Updating it calls `PUT /sleep` and shows confirmation.
    - 17d. **Frontend (Public)**: When `isSleep` is true, temporarily replace normal map UI with a **placeholder view** (wired now as: gray background with text "Map is sleeping – come back soon!"; pulse, marker, and paths hidden). Keep page responsive.
    - 17e. **Tests & docs**: Unit tests for sleep endpoints; frontend test that placeholder renders given mocked `isSleep=true`. Update README with explanation.
    - **Success**: Admin can flip Sleep switch; public site swaps to placeholder view within one refresh, switch back resumes full map.

18. Shop drawer overlay

    - 18a. **Frontend**: Create `Drawer` primitive with overlay/backdrop and slide-in/out animation from right; width 100% on mobile (below `--bp-md` breakpoint), 30% on desktop.
    - 18b. **Frontend**: Create `ShopTab` component: small vertical tab anchored to right side with shop icon (`shop.svg`). Clicking toggles Drawer; include hover/focus styles.
    - 18c. **Integration**: Wire `ShopTab` and `Drawer` in `App.tsx`; manage open/close state via React context or local state. Pressing `Esc` or clicking backdrop closes drawer.
    - 18d. **Accessibility**: Trap focus inside drawer, set `aria-modal="true"` and `role="dialog"`; ensure background content is inert (`aria-hidden`).
    - 18e. **Testing**: Unit tests for open/close interactions, keyboard navigation, and responsive width using viewport mocks.
    - **Success**: On mobile (<768px), drawer covers full viewport; on desktop (≥768px), drawer animates to 30% width; background content is scroll-locked; `Esc` and backdrop close it; vertical tab remains visible when drawer is closed.

19. Merch page 3D Model Viewer

    - 19a. **Dependencies**: Add `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` to frontend `package.json` and install via `npm install`.
    - 19b. **3D asset**: Utilize existing `assets/3D/SpeedPin.glb`; create `types/glb.d.ts` to allow TypeScript import of `.glb` files as string URLs.
    - 19c. **Component**: Create `ModelViewer` React component that renders a `<Canvas>` from `@react-three/fiber`, loads the GLB via `useGLTF`, adds ambient + directional lights and `OrbitControls`; accept optional `height?: number` prop (default 260).
    - 19d. **Integration**: Update `components/Merch.tsx` to render `<ModelViewer />` above the products grid, maintaining responsive layout using the `Stack` primitive.
    - 19e. **Styling**: Apply subtle gradient background and rounded corners to the viewer; respect `prefers-reduced-motion` by disabling auto‐rotate.
    - 19f. **Testing**: Add React Testing Library test that mounts `ModelViewer` and expects a `canvas` element to be in the document without runtime errors.
    - **Success**: Opening the shop drawer shows an interactive 3D model viewer above merch items; model loads within 1 s on broadband; grid layout unaffected; all lints and tests pass.

20. Firebase Integration Epic (Auth, Firestore, Storage)

    - 20a. **Project setup**: Create Firebase project, enable Email/Password auth, Firestore, and Cloud Storage. Add service account JSON (backend) and client config (frontend) to `.env.example`.  
      Success: `npm run dev` & `uvicorn` start without errors reading Firebase env vars.

    - 20b. **Frontend Auth**: Install `firebase` SDK; initialize app in `frontend/src/services/firebase.ts`; update `pages/AdminLogin.tsx` to use `signInWithEmailAndPassword` (no registration). Implement `useAuth` hook to provide `user` and `logout`.  
      Success: Admin can log in with existing Firebase account and log out; auth state persists across reload.

    - 20c. **Backend Auth Verification**: Add Firebase Admin SDK (`backend/requirements.txt`); create `backend/firebase.py` to initialize `firebase_admin`; add FastAPI dependency that verifies the Firebase ID token on protected routes. Remove old env-password auth.  
      Success: Valid Firebase ID token allows access; missing/invalid token returns 401.

    - 20d. **Firestore Data Model**: Design `tourData` collection (one doc per city/date) and `merch` collection (one doc per SKU). Write migration script `scripts/migrate_speeddb_to_firestore.py` to read existing `speed.db` and populate Firestore.  
      Success: All rows present in Firestore; script prints summary counts.

    - 20e. **Backend Data Layer**: Replace SQLite queries with Firestore calls in endpoints (`/journey`, `/cities`, `/merch`, etc.). Abstract via repository pattern for testability.  
      Success: API endpoints return same shape as before but backing data now comes from Firestore.

    - 20f. **Cloud Storage for Merch Assets**: Upload merch images to `gs://<bucket>/merch/<filename>`; store `imageUrl` in `merch` documents. Update frontend merch grid to load from `imageUrl`.  
      Success: Images load via public Storage URLs; performance acceptable.

    - 20g. **Security Rules**: Write Firestore and Storage rules allowing reads for everyone and writes only for authenticated admins.  
      Success: Emulator tests pass; unauthorized writes rejected.

    - 20h. **Testing & CI**: Add unit tests mocking Firebase Admin SDK; add Vitest tests for auth flow; update CI to spin up Firebase emulators for backend tests.  
      Success: All tests pass locally and in CI with emulators.

21. City marker popup (frontend)

    - 21a. **Component**: Create `CityPopup` React component that shows city title and gallery grid of `Card` items (placeholder until Firestore images available). Accept `city` prop containing metadata and `onClose`.
    - 21b. **Responsive behavior**: Use `useMediaQuery('--bp-md')` to switch between full-screen `Drawer` on mobile vs anchored Mapbox `Popup` on desktop.
    - 21c. **Map integration**: In Map/FlatMap component, iterate existing city markers; attach `onClick` to set `selectedCity` state and render `CityPopup` accordingly.
    - 21d. **Accessibility & UX**: Provide close button, backdrop (mobile), ESC key close; focus trap.
    - 21e. **Testing**: Unit test that popup opens/closes and renders title based on selected marker; viewport mocked for mobile & desktop.
    - **Success**: Clicking any city marker opens popup with correct city title; on mobile view (<768px) popup covers viewport; closing resumes map interactions; tests pass.

22. Social media integration (Instagram & TikTok via Apify)

- 22a. **Data model**: Add `lastCurrentAt` timestamp column to `City` SQLModel (or Firestore field) to record when `is_current` toggled true.
- 22b. **Backend logic**: Update `/cities/{id}` mutation to set `lastCurrentAt` and ensure only one city is current.
- 22c. **Scraper module**: Install `apify-client` in `backend/requirements.txt`; create `backend/social_scraper.py` that triggers Apify actors for Instagram & TikTok queries like `"@{profile}"` and city keywords since `lastCurrentAt`.
- 22d. **Scheduler**: Add background job scheduler (e.g., `apscheduler` or Celery beat) that runs every `SOCIAL_SCRAPE_INTERVAL_MIN` (env) and populates Firestore `cities/{cityId}/posts`.
- 22e. **Filtering**: Include only posts newer than `lastCurrentAt`, mentioning target profiles/keywords, and (if available) within city geo-bounds (`city_polygon` or ±30 mi bounding box).
- 22f. **Storage**: Persist top 20–100 scored posts per city (fields: `platform`, `postId`, `username`, `caption`, `mediaUrl`, `likes`, `timestamp`, `lat`, `lng`, `score`).
- 22g. **API endpoint**: Expose `GET /cities/{id}/posts` returning list of post DTOs sorted by score desc (anonymous).
- 22h. **Frontend**: Update `CityPopup` to fetch posts and render as `Card` gallery; gracefully handle loading/empty/error states.
- 22i. **Testing & docs**: Unit tests mocking Apify responses, integration tests for endpoint, Vitest tests for gallery rendering; update README/env docs (`APIFY_TOKEN`, `SOCIAL_SCRAPE_INTERVAL_MIN`, `SOCIAL_PROFILES`).
- **Success**: After toggling a city to current, within the configured interval its popup shows a gallery of relevant IG/TikTok posts; tests pass and manual spot-check shows accuracy.

24. Contextual Tip System (frontend)

- 24a. Inject Help affordance: Add a small circular "?" help button to the top-right overlay stack (inside `App.tsx` overlay near `Header`). Temporary implementation can be a styled button; later we can swap to an SVG icon.

  - Success: Button renders at top-right on all breakpoints with z-index above header; click opens tip sequence.

- 24b. Tip data model: Define a typed `TipStep` array with fields `{ id, imageUrl, target: SelectorOrRef, placement, continueMode }` where `continueMode` ∈ `"nextButton" | "clickTarget" | "waitCondition"`.

  - Success: Strongly typed steps; compile-time safety; initial steps include:
    1.  Prompt: points at the help button, continueMode = `nextButton`.
    2.  Discover Merch: points at ShopTab, continueMode = `clickTarget` (user must open).
    3.  Inside Merch: anchors to Drawer header or first card area, continueMode = `nextButton`.

- 24c. Spotlight overlay: Implement `SpotlightOverlay` that dims the page with 4 absolute-positioned rectangles around a computed bounding rect of the target to leave a “hole” over the target. Allow pointer-events only through the hole and tip card; block elsewhere.

  - Success: Background is visually dim; only target area remains fully visible and clickable; smooth on resize/scroll; no layout shift.

- 24d. TipSystem component + context: Manage current step index, expose `start()`, `next()`, `close()`, and auto-prompt logic (e.g., show first tip once after 12s if never seen this session). Persist `tipPromptShown` and `tipCompletedIds` in `localStorage`.

  - Success: Auto-prompt happens once per session; manual trigger via help button works; state survives quick navigations.

  - 24d.1. Auto-prompt settings (CONFIRMED): Delay 12 seconds, frequency once per session.
    - Success: After 12s idle on first visit of session, show tip-1; do not re-show after dismissal until a new session.

- 24e. Merch drawer integration: Wire a step whose `continueMode = "clickTarget"` to require opening the drawer. Observe `shopOpen` state from `App.tsx` via context/props to detect when to advance to the next step. Ensure tip overlay stacks above Drawer/backdrop.

  - Success: When user taps ShopTab, drawer opens and tips continue; overlay doesn’t obstruct the ShopTab’s clickable area.

  - 24e.1. Required action (CONFIRMED): Opening the Merch drawer is required to proceed (no skip on that step).

- 24f. Accessibility and controls: Esc closes tips; arrow/Tab navigation constrained within tip card; tip card has `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`.

  - Success: Keyboard-only user can operate; screen reader announces tip content.

  - 24f.1. "Don’t show again" (CONFIRMED): Provide a control to suppress future auto-prompts and sequences; persist in `localStorage` (e.g., `tips_suppressed = true`).

- 24g. Tests: Add Vitest/RTL tests to verify auto-prompt gating, step advancement, spotlight hole math around a mocked target, and the drawer-advance condition.

  - Success: Tests pass locally and in CI; no lints introduced.

- 24h. Assets: Use existing `frontend/src/assets/Tips/tip-1.png` (and siblings) for the image content in the tip card. Lazy-load subsequent images just-in-time.

  - Success: Images render crisp on mobile & desktop; no layout jank.

  - 24i. Customizable order (CONFIRMED): `tip-1.png` is always the initial prompt; subsequent steps order is configurable.

    - Implement `frontend/src/tips/tipsConfig.ts` exporting a `TipStep[]` constructed from reusable step templates. User can reorder steps without code changes elsewhere.
    - Success: Reordering `tipsConfig` changes runtime sequence immediately.

  - 24j. Targets & anchors (CONFIRMED): Spotlight targets include Help, ShopTab, Quote, Current City marker, Merch first card, Animation star icons, and a future Time Limit badge.
    - Introduce stable anchors via `data-tip-target` attributes:
      - Help: `data-tip-target="help"` (Help button in overlay)
      - ShopTab: `data-tip-target="shoptab"` (root of `ShopTab`)
      - Quote: `data-tip-target="quote"` (wrapper in `Quote.tsx`)
      - Current city: `data-tip-target="current-city"` (Mapbox marker container in `FlatMap.tsx`)
      - Merch card: `data-tip-target="merch-card"` (first product `Card` in `Merch.tsx`)
      - Animation icons: `data-tip-target="anim-icons"` (container around the shape buttons)
      - Time limit: `data-tip-target="time-limit"` (placeholder element adjacent to price; becomes active when feature lands)
    - Success: Spotlight positions correctly over each target; when a target does not exist yet (e.g., time limit), that step is deferred or skipped gracefully with clear messaging.

23. Lightweight 3D Model Viewer (SpeedLowPoly + animation selector)

    - 23a. **Asset Preparation**: Use the new `assets/3D/SpeedLowPoly.glb` (already low-poly with baked animation). Verify file ≤5 MB; if larger, consider Draco compression via `gltf-pipeline`.
    - 23b. **Viewer Refactor**: Update `ModelViewer.tsx` to default to this GLB and expose available animations via `useAnimations`. Accept props:
      • `initialAnimation?: string` (default first)
      • `onAnimationChange?(name: string)`
    - 23c. **Animation Switching UI**: Add a small segmented control/drop-down inside `Merch.tsx` (desktop) or below canvas (mobile) listing animation clips (e.g., "Idle", "Wave", "Ride"). Switching updates `actions[current].play()` and fades out previous.
    - 23d. **Progressive Loading**: Show static PNG placeholder (existing `SpeedMotorcycle_00000.png`) wrapped in `Suspense` fallback; display load % via `useProgress` in dev mode.
    - 23e. **Performance Budget**: TTI impact ≤100 ms, memory ≤20 MB on simulated mid-range mobile. Document Lighthouse numbers in PR description.
    - 23f. **Testing**: Vitest test mounts viewer, waits for GLTF loader promise resolve, and asserts that animation mixer exists. Test animation switch triggers `play` on new action without console errors.
    - 23g. **Clothing Variants Pipeline**:
      • Export **shirtless base model** (`SpeedLowPoly_Base.glb`) but KEEP a distinct skinned **shirt mesh** whose material is named `ShirtMaterial`. Leave its texture slot empty or a neutral placeholder.
      • For each merch design, export a **texture PNG (or jpg, KTX2)** named `<sku>_Shirt_Diffuse.png` sized ≤1 k px, targeting the UVs of `ShirtMaterial`.
      • Optimise textures via `squoosh-cli --mozjpeg` or Basis/KTX2 if GPU compression desired; place outputs in `assets/3D/shirts/`.
    - 23h. **Viewer Clothing API**:
      • Extend `ModelViewer.tsx` with `shirtTexture?: string` prop.
      • On change, find the mesh whose material.name === `ShirtMaterial`.
      • Determine shirtless state by checking if `material.map?.name === "ShitBaseTexture"` (placeholder base texture). If yes, hide: `material.transparent=true; material.opacity=0` (or `mesh.visible=false`).
      • When a merch texture is provided, load with `TextureLoader` (or `useTexture`), assign to `material.map`, restore opacity/visibility, and set `material.needsUpdate = true`. Optionally fade between textures.
    - 23i. **Animation System**:
      • Use `useAnimations` from `@react-three/drei` to bind clips returned by `useGLTF`.
      • Build an `animationNames` array from `clips.map(c => c.name)`; default play first clip.
      • Expose `currentAnimation` and `setAnimation` via component props OR internal state + UI (segmented control/drop-down).
      • When animation changes: `actions[prev].fadeOut(0.2); actions[next].reset().fadeIn(0.2).play();`.
    - 23j. **Merch Drawer Integration**:
      • Ensure each merch document in Firestore includes `shirtTexture` (relative URL like `shirts/<sku>_Shirt_Diffuse.png`) and optional `defaultAnimation`.
      • Update `services/api.ts` merch fetch to include this field; extend `MerchItem` TypeScript type accordingly.
      • `Merch.tsx`: on merch card click, pass `item.shirtTexture` to `<ModelViewer shirtTexture={...} />`; also switch animation if `defaultAnimation` present.
    - 23k. **Testing**: Unit test texture swap updates `material.map.uuid` and animation switch triggers new clip without console errors.
    - **Success**: Viewer loads base model; texture swap on shirt mesh works instantly when merch clicked; user can switch among available animation clips; performance budgets intact; tests & lints pass.

#### 24.x Implementation Details & Remaining Plan

- **Targets implemented**:

  - `data-tip-target="help"` → Help button (top-right)
  - `data-tip-target="shoptab"` → `ShopTab` root (right side)
  - `data-tip-target="quote"` → `Quote` wrapper
  - `data-tip-target="current-city"` → animated marker container in `FlatMap`
  - `data-tip-target="merch-card"` → first merch `Card` in `Merch`
  - `data-tip-target="anim-icons"` → container around animation icon buttons in `Merch`

- **Config & step sequence** (`frontend/src/tips/tipsConfig.ts`):

  - Steps added for Help prompt, Quote, Current City, ShopTab (click required), Merch first card, Animation icons.
  - Order is fully customizable; set `continueMode` per step: `tapAnywhere`, `clickTarget`, or `waitCondition`.
  - Desktop/mobile placements editable via `placementDesktop` / `placementMobile` with `{ anchor, offsetX, offsetY, rotationDeg }`.

- **Debug & authoring**:

  - URL flags: `tipsForce=1` to start immediately; `tipsDebug=1` to enable drag; `tipsStep=<id>` or `tipsIndex=<n>` to jump to a specific step.
  - In debug, drag the tip image to refine offsets; press “Copy placement” to paste into the config for permanence.

- **Spotlight readiness**:

  - Overlay renders only after the target element exists; system checks every 200 ms and renders once found.
  - For elements rendered later (e.g., map marker), scroll/pan if needed; overlay will attach once target appears.

- **Persistence**:

  - Auto-prompt shown once per session (12 s after load). `Don’t show again` persists suppression in `localStorage`.
  - Drag-adjusted positions persist in-memory for the session; copy/paste into config to make them permanent.

- **Accessibility**:

  - Dimming uses high-contrast overlay; tip is keyboard-focusable; Esc closes; background inertness via overlay.

- **Next steps**:
  - Add optional `waitCondition` for “time limit” badge (`data-tip-target="time-limit"`) once implemented.
  - Write unit tests for: auto-prompt gating, step advancement (tapAnywhere/clickTarget), target readiness polling, and spotlight geometry.
  - Consider persisting per-device placement overrides in `localStorage` keyed by step id and breakpoint.

### Current Status / Progress Tracking

|- 🚀 Firebase integration epic complete: Frontend auth, backend token verification, Firestore data layer, Cloud Storage images (pending merch images upload manually).
|- 🛠️ Task 20e: Added `backend/firestore_repo.py`; refactored `/api/status` GET & POST to use Firestore. Next: refactor `/cities`, `/journey`, `/sleep` endpoints.
|- ✅ Task 20b complete: Front-end AuthProvider & AdminLogin now use Firebase. Manual test pending but code compiles.
|- 🛠️ Started task 20c: Updated `backend/auth.py` to verify ID tokens via Firebase Admin and changed protected route dependency. Deprecated old /api/auth/login/logout endpoints in `backend/main.py`.
|- 🐞 Task 22 progress: Debug run produced IG:1, TW:10 raw posts but 0 after filtering; needs filter & search refinement (see Task 22e–22f).

|- ✅ Switched to hashtag-based ingestion path
| - Added `socialHashtag` setting (default `SpeedDoesAmerica`) in backend repo defaults and API schema
| - Implemented `search_*_hashtag` and `scrape_hashtag_posts` in `backend/social_scraper.py`
| - Scheduler and manual scrape now use `socialHashtag` when present; otherwise fallback to profile+keywords
| - Admin Dashboard now exposes a "Hashtag (no #)" field in Social Settings
| - CityPopup already reads posts from Firestore; no UI change needed

|- ⚠️ To run scrapes, we need a valid `APIFY_TOKEN` in backend env. No platform API keys are needed for this Apify actor pathway.

|- 📝 Planned: Tip System
| - Help button location: top-right of overlay stack (above `Header`)
| - Auto-prompt: show tip-1 once after ~12s per session
| - Spotlight: 4-rect approach to leave interactive hole over target
| - First target: help button; second target: `ShopTab`; third: Drawer header
| - Z-index plan: Tip overlay 3000+, above Drawer (1500) and ShopTab (1400)

### Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Please create a Firebase project (if not already) and download a service account JSON key.
- Place the JSON somewhere outside the repo and set `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` in your `.env` to its absolute path.
- Fill in the VITE*FIREBASE*\* variables in `.env` with values from **Project Settings → General → Your apps**.
- Let me know when credentials are in place so I can run the project locally and confirm successful initialisation before proceeding to frontend auth (task 20b).
- Please verify that the _current city_ document has an accurate `lastCurrentAt` ISO timestamp (e.g., within the last 48 h) so filters do not exclude valid posts. If stale, toggle city to current again to refresh the timestamp for testing.

- Provide an `APIFY_TOKEN` in the backend environment so hashtag scraping can run. Without it, scrapes will return empty. Optional: confirm preferred hashtag (defaulted to `SpeedDoesAmerica`, case-insensitive).

- Tip System confirmations requested:
  - Confirm the auto-prompt delay (proposed 12 seconds) and frequency (per session).
  - Provide the desired order and copy for tips (we will use `Tips/tip-1.png`, `tip-2.png`, etc.).
  - Confirm which controls we should spotlight beyond Help and ShopTab (add any other icon targets).
  - Is the “open Merch drawer” step required to proceed, or should we allow a skip? Proposed: required to proceed for onboarding.
  - Do we need a “Don’t show again” control in the tip card?

### Recent Enhancements (Latest Session)

#### ✅ **Design System Updates**

- **American Theme Implementation**: Added patriotic color palette with Liberty Blue (#0A3161), Freedom Red (#B31942), Star White (#FFFFFF), Steel Gray (#4B4B4B), Sky Stripe (#3C8DFF), and Vintage Gold (#FFD700)
- **Site Branding**: Replaced chromatic text header with "Speed Does America" graphic logo from assets
- **Typography**: Integrated HWT American Adobe Font for authentic American aesthetic

#### ✅ **Privacy-Focused Location System**

- **1-Mile Privacy Zone**: Replaced expanding pulse ring with fixed 1-mile radius circle
- **Random Location Offset**: Generates random point within 1-mile radius to protect exact location privacy
- **Privacy Indicator**: Added "Approximate location within 1 mile" notice in map popup
- **Random Location Icons**: 11 different location markers that randomly select on each page load
- **Gentle Animation**: Subtle transparency pulse on the area circle instead of aggressive expanding rings

#### ✅ **Google Places API Integration**

- **Backend Proxy**: Created `/places/search` endpoint to avoid CORS issues with direct Google API calls
- **Real-time Autocomplete**: Address search with debounced queries (300ms) and up to 5 suggestions
- **Smart Coordinate Population**: Auto-fills lat/lng fields when user selects from address suggestions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys, Enter, and Escape support for accessibility
- **Enhanced UX**: Loading states, error handling, and focus management

#### ✅ **Map System Improvements**

- **Coordinate Validation**: Added safeguards against invalid lat/lng values causing Mapbox errors
- **Simplified Offset Algorithm**: Replaced complex trigonometric calculations with simpler degree-based offsets
- **Fixed Lat/Lng Order Bug**: getRandomOffsetLocation now returns coordinates in [lng, lat] order, resolving Mapbox "Invalid LngLat latitude" error
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of edge cases and invalid coordinate scenarios
- **Performance**: Optimized random calculations and reduced complexity

#### ⚠️ **Known Issues**

- **React Boolean Warning**: Still receiving "Received `false` for a non-boolean attribute `error`" in console
- **Input Component**: Need to verify onKeyDown prop is properly handled in primitives
- \*\*Mapbox "Invalid LngLat latitude value" error due to swapped lat/lng order (fixed by returning [lng, lat] in helper).~~

#### 🚧 **Technical Debt**

- Need comprehensive testing for new Google Places integration
- Should add environment variable validation for Google API key
- Consider adding rate limiting for Places API proxy endpoint

- 🚧 **Next**: Task 7 (Tests for backend + minimal frontend coverage)
- 🔨 **Executor**: Backend city data layer operational; proceeding to frontend admin UI next session.

#### ✅ **Shop Drawer Fixes**

- Fixed back/close button inside Tour Merch drawer not closing the drawer (ensured `onClose` wiring and verified state update)
- Switched chevron icon direction from `right-chevron` to `left-chevron` for better UX consistency (in both `Drawer` close button and `ShopTab` toggle)
- No linter issues introduced; manual functional test pending

- Fixed dev JSON parse error by reading `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `frontend/src/services/api.ts`; falls back to `window.location.origin` for production.

#### ✅ Admin control: City Start time + Social posts partitioning

- Added a "Start" datetime field to the admin City Edit dialog (`frontend/src/components/CityEditDialog.tsx`) that maps to `last_current_at`.
- Wired save flow in `CityTable` to send `last_current_at` when provided.
- Backend now sorts posts by `timestamp` before saving to each city's `posts` subcollection (`backend/firestore_repo.py::save_city_posts`).
- Implemented `repartition_posts_across_cities()` to reassign posts into each city's subcollection based on city start windows. Triggered automatically when `last_current_at` is updated via `PUT /api/cities/{id}`.
- Added scheduler diagnostics endpoint `GET /api/scheduler/status` and scheduler tracking of last run info to validate scrapes on deployment.

Current Status / Progress Tracking

- Admin can manually set a city's Start time. On update, backend repartitions posts and ensures per-city posts are sorted by time.
- Scheduler status endpoint reports if scraping is enabled, interval, current city, Curator/hashtag mode, token presence, and last run summary.

Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Please test: In Admin → Journey Cities, click edit on the current city, set "Start" to a recent time, save. Confirm `/api/cities/{id}` returns updated `lastCurrentAt` and city gallery shows expected posts.
- Verify on production: call `/api/scheduler/status` and share the JSON to confirm scraping is active. Ensure `APIFY_TOKEN` is set (or Curator JSON/API configured) and that `socialScrapeIntervalMin` is reasonable (e.g., 60).

Lessons

- When assigning social posts to cities, compute city windows from `lastCurrentAt` and sort posts by `timestamp` to keep gallery order stable.

### Mobile Shop Interactions (iOS)

- Goal: Make dragging the Shop tab smooth and reliable on iPhone; ensure the merch list scrolls smoothly with native momentum on mobile.

#### High-level Task Breakdown (Mobile Shop)

1. Improve ShopTab drag on iOS (disable default touch behaviors, add cancel handling, smooth transforms). Success: No accidental page scroll, smooth drag, tap still toggles.
2. Use native horizontal scrolling for merch list on mobile (remove custom drag handlers, set correct touch-action). Success: Smooth inertial scroll with scroll-snap; taps on cards/buttons unaffected.

### Project Status Board (Mobile Shop)

- [in_progress] Improve ShopTab drag on iOS
- [ ] Switch merch list to native horizontal scroll on mobile

### Current Status / Progress Tracking (Mobile Shop)

- Starting with ShopTab drag improvements: add `touch-action: none`, disable tap highlight/selection, add `will-change: transform`, and handle `pointercancel` similar to `pointerup`.

### Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests (Mobile Shop)

- After I push the ShopTab change, please test on an actual iPhone and report: 1) Does the tab drag smoothly without scrolling the page? 2) Does a quick tap still toggle reliably?

### New Feature: Merch time-limit countdown and auto-disable

Background and Motivation

- Each merch item may have a limited availability window. We want to display a countdown next to the price and automatically disable items past the set time.

Key Challenges and Analysis

- Data model must include an `autoDisableAt` ISO timestamp.
- Backend must read/write this field and return it in `/api/merch`.
- Admin UI must support editing via a datetime picker and quick-clear.
- Frontend must render a live countdown efficiently without excessive re-renders.
- Expired items should not be purchasable; either hidden on fetch or disabled in UI.

High-level Task Breakdown

1. Backend: Add `autoDisableAt` to merch create/update schemas and pass-through to Firestore repository. Success: Field persisted and returned by `/api/merch`.
2. Frontend types: Extend `MerchItem` and API helpers to include `autoDisableAt`. Success: Type compiles; field visible in fetched data.
3. Admin UI: Add datetime-local field to `AdminMerch` create/edit form and table display; allow clearing value. Success: Admin can set/clear time; updates persist.
4. Merch UI: Show countdown to `autoDisableAt` next to price; disable Add to Cart and mark as "Unavailable" when expired; optionally filter out expired in fetch. Success: Countdown ticks every second; UX clear on expiry.

Project Status Board (Merch Countdown)

- [ ] Backend: Add `autoDisableAt` to merch models and API
- [ ] Frontend: Extend MerchItem type and API
- [ ] Admin UI: Edit/display `autoDisableAt`
- [ ] Merch UI: Countdown and disable/hide on expiry

Current Status / Progress Tracking

- Starting backend schema updates in FastAPI and Firestore repo.

Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- None yet; will request confirmation whether to hide expired items from the public list or show with disabled state.

Lessons

- Prefer server-side filtering of expired items to avoid client clock skew; if not feasible, include both server and client guards.

### City Locator Icons via Firestore

Background and Motivation

- We want past-city markers on the map to use per-city locator icons when available, falling back to bundled defaults. Admins should upload/update the icon from the dashboard, and the URL should be stored on each city document in Firestore.

Key Challenges and Analysis

- Ensure journey responses include `locatorIconUrl`/`locatorPng` for both `currentCity` and `path` elements.
- Keep map fast: read optional URL directly without additional API calls.
- Provide admin upload flow that writes to Cloud Storage and persists the public URL on the corresponding Firestore city document.

High-level Task Breakdown

1. Backend: Add POST `/api/cities/{id}/locator-icon` to accept PNG, upload to Storage, and persist URL under `locatorIconUrl` (with legacy alias `locatorPng`). Success: returns `{ url }`; Firestore city document has the URL fields.
2. Frontend (Admin): Extend City Edit dialog with a PNG file input and preview; on Save, call upload endpoint after textual fields save. Success: Icon uploads, preview updates, subsequent city fetch shows URL.
3. Frontend (Map): When rendering past markers, first use `city.locatorIconUrl || city.locatorPng`, else fallback to a random bundled icon. Success: Past markers with uploaded icons render the custom image at appropriate size; others use defaults.

Project Status Board (Locator Icons)

- [x] Backend upload endpoint and Firestore field persistence
- [x] Admin UI file input + upload + preview in `CityEditDialog`
- [x] Map past markers prefer Firestore `locatorIconUrl`/`locatorPng` before defaults

Current Status / Progress Tracking

- Verified backend endpoint at `/api/cities/{city_id}/locator-icon` uploads to GCS and stores `locatorIconUrl` and `locatorPng` on the city doc. Admin UI (`Journey Cities` → Edit) includes a PNG uploader and calls the upload endpoint. `FlatMap.tsx` reads `(pt as any).locatorIconUrl || (pt as any).locatorPng` for past-city markers and falls back to bundled icons.

Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Please test in Admin → Journey Cities: click Edit on a city, upload a small PNG locator icon, Save. Then refresh the map and confirm that city's past marker uses the uploaded icon. Share any CORS or scaling issues you observe.

Lessons

- Returning full city docs from `/api/journey` lets the map consume optional fields like locator URLs without additional queries; keep types permissive for forward compatibility.
